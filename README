What is this?
====================================================
Struts2GWTPlugin is a Struts 2 plugin which allows developers using the Google Web Toolkit (GWT)
to call Struts actions and return GWT RPC-compatible objects without writing wrapping classes or
additional code. This plugin returns an actual GWT RPC object, NOT the standard Struts result.
This also allows your GWT application to operate normally without any special coding on the client, 
just follow the standard GWT RPC programming model.


How do you use this?
====================================================
To use the plug-in do the following:

1. Add the plugin JAR file to your project's classpath
2. Edit your struts.xml file so that your package extends the "gwt-default" package
3. For actions using the plugin, add the interceptor reference: <interceptor-ref name="gwt"/>. This should be the last interceptor as it terminates the chain.

That's it, there is nothing more to do. Now when the client calls your action it will receive 
the GWT RPC object instead of the Struts result.
